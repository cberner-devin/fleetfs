# fleetfs
FleetFS distributed filesystem

## Development
* `apt install libfuse-dev` (needed by `fuse` dependency)
* Install flatc (https://github.com/google/flatbuffers)

## Status
Very very alpha. Expect FleetFS to eat your data :)

**Features implemented:**
* basic operations: read/write/create/delete/rename
* file permissions (read/write/exec), but not ownership
